# Course-Stuff
# Random Scripts/Fun for the Course

This branch contains stuff I'm experimenting with for the A28 CANO course. Take whatever you want.

Disclaimer: I am a huge retard, most of this may not even work.

mac_targets.py
This is a python script that will automatically format a list of MACs for your kismet_site.conf file.
1. Copy the file into your directory and make it executable
2. Run the script with the command: python3 (or your version) mac_targets.py
3. Input a list of MACs separated by spaces and hit enter
4. Copy the formats and paste them into your kismet_site.conf file
5. Profit

Future updates will include handling for newline characters and possibly automatically configure and build a new kismet_site.conf based on your inputs.
